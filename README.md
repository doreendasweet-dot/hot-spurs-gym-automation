# 🏋️ Hot Spurs Gym — Membership Management Automation

A fully automated gym membership management system built with **n8n**, **Airtable**, **Fillout**, **Cloudinary**, **Gmail**, and **Telegram**. This project automates the entire member lifecycle — from registration to expiry and renewal — with zero manual intervention required.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Hot Spurs Gym is a Lagos-based fitness centre. This automation system handles:

- **New member onboarding** — form submission triggers photo upload, Airtable record creation, and a branded welcome email
- **Renewal reminders** — members are automatically notified 3 days before their membership expires
- **Expiry management** — expired memberships are auto-detected, status updated, and members notified with a renewal link
- **Renewal processing** — when a member renews, their Airtable record is automatically updated with new dates, plan, and amount

## 🐛 Key Debugging Insights

This project involved resolving several non-obvious bugs during development:

- **Fillout Advanced mode** sending empty payloads (fix: revert to Simple mode)
- **Test vs Production webhook URL** causing silent failures in live submissions
- **Merge node "Choose Branch"** not auto-detecting active input (fix: switch to Append mode)
- **Cloudinary node reference** breaking no-photo path (fix: `.isExecuted` conditional fallback)
